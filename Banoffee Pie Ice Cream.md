Preparation: 40 min  

## Ingredients
Half and half - ½ cup
Condensed milk - 1 can (14 oz.)
Canned dulce de leche - 1 can (14 oz.), divided
Dash of fine sea salt
Heavy cream (whipping cream), chilled - 2 cups
Heath bits - about 1 cup
Banana Pudding - about half a recipe
Biscoff Cookies, crushed - about half a cup

## Materials
Ice Cream machine

## Method
In a bowl mix the ½ cup of half and half, the can of condensed milk, half of the dulce de leche and the dash of salt.

Set your stand mixer or electric hand mixer. In another bowl whip the 2 ½ cups of heavy cream until frothy and foamy in slow to medium speed. Whip for 1 to 2 minutes if using your ice cream machine or 2 to 3 minutes if doing the no-churn alternative.

Reduce speed to the lowest and slowly pour the half and half mixture while still whipping your cream. Mix until combined.

If using the ice cream machine:

Transfer to your ice cream machine with the ice cream paddle already attached. Churn the ice cream about 40 minutes. At the very last minute drop the brownie pieces and drizzle the remaining ½ can of dulce de leche. Scrape ice cream to a freezer container and wrap it a few times with plastic paper to prevent ice crystals. Freeze 6 to 8 hours to get the ice cream firm and set.

Mix in pudding and heath bits.

## Conclusion
You can also mix in extra dulce le leche.
